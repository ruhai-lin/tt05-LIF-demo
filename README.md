# Adaptive Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Chip

## Project Introduction:
The Adaptive Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Chip is an advanced project developed using the Tiny Tapeout template. This chip is focused on neuromorphic computing, specifically implementing an adaptive Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model. The aim of the project is to construct a low-power, sparse Spiking Neural Network (SNN) by simulating the biological characteristics of neurons.

## Tiny Tapeout

TinyTapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip.

## Technical Details:

- **Chip Functionality:** The chip is capable of receiving an 8-bit electrical current stimulus (input) and outputting a 1-bit spike signal. This design emulates the working mode of biological neurons, generating an electrical signal in response to specific stimuli.
- **Technical Foundation:** The project uses the tinytapeout template, combined with the advantages of the Efabless 2311C chipIgnite shuttle, and utilizes the Skywater 130nm open-source Process Design Kit (PDK).
- **Application Fields:** The chip can be widely applied in scenarios that require the simulation of neuronal activity, especially significant in the construction of Spiking Neural Networks. Its low-power feature makes it suitable for energy-constrained applications.

## Project Goals and Applications:
The primary goal of the Adaptive Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Chip is to provide a practical and efficient way to simulate the behavior of real neurons. With this simulation, the chip is expected to have applications in various domains, including but not limited to biomedical research, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and in building more efficient computational models for edge computing devices.
